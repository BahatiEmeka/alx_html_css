# Web Page Design Implementation from Figma

## Project Overview
This project seeks to build a fully functional and responsive webpage based on a provided Figma design. The objective is to recreate the design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS, applying the principles of responsive design, accessibility, and layout structuring without the use of any external CSS libraries or JavaScript.

## Designer
The webpage has been designed by **Nicolas Philippot**, a UI/UX designer. The design file is available on Figma and contains all the necessary assets and guidelines to ensure the webpage matches the desired look and feel.

## Project Requirements
- **No external CSS frameworks** (like Bootstrap) should be used.
- **No JavaScript** is allowed for this implementation.
- The webpage should be **fully responsive** and look identical to the Figma file design.

## Tasks

### 1. Familiarize Yourself with Figma
- Create an account in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and open the provided project.
- Duplicate the project into your drafts to get access to all the design details.
  
If you cannot access the Figma file, you can download it directly using this [link](#) (add link to the Figma file).

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure you have the correct fonts installed on your machine. The fonts used in this design are:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](#) (link to the font source)
- If you encounter float values in the Figma design (e.g., for dimensions or spacing), feel free to round them to the nearest whole number for implementation purposes.

### 2. Implement the Web Page
- Recreate the design layout using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Apply the following rules for responsiveness:
  - Ensure the webpage switches to the mobile version when the screen width is **480px** or less.
  - The **maximum width** of the content should be **1000px**, and it should be **centered** on the page.

### 3. Interaction States
- Ensure interactive elements such as links and buttons have the correct hover/active states:
  - **Links**: On hover/active, links should change to **#FF6565**.
  - **Buttons**: On hover/active, buttons should have an opacity of **0.9**.

### 4. Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure that the webpage meets basic accessibility guidelines:
  - All images should have appropriate **alt text**.
  - Use **semantic HTML elements** to improve the webpageâ€™s structure and accessibility (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
  - Ensure text contrast is sufficient to be easily readable for all users.

### 5. Testing the Web Page
- Test the responsiveness of the webpage by resizing your browser window or using developer tools to simulate various screen sizes.
- Make sure that the mobile version of the webpage appears correctly when the screen width is **480px** or less
